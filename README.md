# -Fuel-efficiency-prediction

**summary of the project**
The workbook studies car data using the ISLP package. It checks features like mileage, weight, horsepower, and model year. The data was cleaned and analyzed using charts and statistics. It shows that lighter and newer cars give better mileage. The workbook helps to understand and predict fuel efficiency.
